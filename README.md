# model-systems-disease-research
Comparative analysis of model system usage across cancer, HIV-1, and autoimmune disease research using recent literature and R-based exploratory analysis.

# Discussion
This exploratory, literature-derived analysis aimed to compare the usage of model organisms across cancer, infectious (HIV-1), and autoimmune disease research, with a focus on emerging experimental systems and translational relevance. Rather than evaluating experimental performance, this study examined patterns of model selection reported in recent peer-reviewed studies to identify prevailing trends and potential underutilised systems.

## Emergence of organoids as complementary systems

Organoid-based systems have been observed across multiple disease classes, particularly in cancer and autoimmune research, often in studies focused on mechanisms, immune signalling, or early translational questions. While their representation remains lower than that of traditional in vivo models, their cross-disease presence supports the view that organoids are increasingly being adopted as complementary rather than replacement systems. This trend aligns with their ability to recapitulate tissue architecture, while allowing experimental control that is not feasible in whole-animal models.

## Continued dominance of mouse models in cancer research

Mouse models remain the most frequently used system in cancer studies, reflecting their established role in tumour biology, immunotherapy evaluation, and systemic immune interactions. Despite the availability of alternative models, the consistency of murine usage underscores their continued relevance for complex in vivo cancer questions, particularly those involving immune–tumour dynamics.

## Model convergence in immune-related cancer–autoimmune contexts

Studies addressing immune-related mechanisms at the intersection of cancer and autoimmune disease showed overlapping model usage patterns, primarily favouring mammalian systems. This convergence suggests that shared immunopathological features drive similar experimental requirements, reinforcing the importance of models capable of capturing systemic immune regulation.

## Zebrafish as an underleveraged cross-disease model

Zebrafish models appeared infrequently compared to mice but were used across multiple disease classes, predominantly in mechanistic and immunological studies. Their limited representation, despite demonstrated versatility, suggests underutilisation rather than lack of applicability. These findings support the use of zebrafish as a complementary experimental system with potential for broader adoption, particularly in early-stage and pathway-focused research.

## Diversified modelling strategies in HIV-1 research

HIV-1 studies exhibited a distinct model usage profile characterised by reduced reliance on murine systems and increased use of in vitro and alternative models. This pattern reflects known biological constraints of mouse models for HIV infection and highlights a diversified experimental strategy rather than a simple shift away from in vivo research. These findings reinforce the importance of model choice being guided by biological feasibility rather than convention.

## Limitations

This study is limited by its small sample size and reliance on literature-derived classifications rather than primary experimental outcomes. The analysis reflects reported study emphasis rather than experimental success or efficiency. Additionally, heterogeneity in terminology and study scope may influence categorisation despite careful curation.

## Conclusion

Overall, this analysis reveals that the choice of model organism in biomedical research is influenced by disease biology, experimental objectives, and translational constraints. While traditional in vivo systems remain central, emerging and alternative models are increasingly integrated in complementary roles. Understanding these patterns is essential for designing biologically appropriate and ethically informed experimental strategies in future disease research.
